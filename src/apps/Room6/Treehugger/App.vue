	<div class="squareoff">Treehugger: Wawona VR experience transports the users to the red giant Sequoia trees from the Sequoia National Park. It provides a sense of intimacy with the tree - with its bark, with the cells that make up its being. The vividness of the work illustrates <em>presence</em>. </div>
  <!-- In this experience, users find themselves on the threshold of forgetting that we are having a VR experience. Being on that threshold is a sence of presence in a reality medium. -->
