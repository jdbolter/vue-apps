  <blockquote class="squareoff">"When you’re inside of the headset . . . you see full 360 degrees, in all directions. And when you’re sitting there in her room, watching her, you're not watching it through a television screen, you’re not watching it through a window, you’re sitting there with her. When you look down, you're sitting on the same ground that she’s sitting on. And because of that, you feel her humanity in a deeper way. You empathize with her in a deeper way. (Milk 2015)"</blockquote>
