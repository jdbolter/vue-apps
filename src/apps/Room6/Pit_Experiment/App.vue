  	   <div class="squareoff">The Pit experiments were conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina in the early 2000s, to establish empirical evidence of presence in virtual reality. They constructed a physical set, complete with platforms and walls, that matched the virtual scene. The subjects were asked to perform simple tasks that involved walking to the edge of a virtual pit. Researchers measured their physiological reactions to see if they experienced signs of fear, such as an accelerated heart beat. Pass through the portal to experience a replica of one version of their Pit Room yourself.
