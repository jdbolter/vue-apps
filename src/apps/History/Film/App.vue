The first fully dynamic reality media was seen in the 1980s, when the Lumière brothers created cinématographe, which is one of the first motion picture apparatus. With this device, they made 'The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station', which showcased their success in reproducing a facet of reality that photography could not, by having motion and time.
