Around 1425, Italian Renaissance architect Filippo Brunelleschi demonstrated linear perspective with the help of a mirror. Using the technique of parallel lines converging in a single vanishing point and a mirror, he painted the Florence Baptistry. This is the first example of diminished reality, in which the real world is overlayed and obscured by the technology.
